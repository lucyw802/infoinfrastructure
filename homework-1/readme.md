### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Github hosts and displays code. You upload the VS code to GitHub and the TA's and professor can see it. If you make changes to your code you can upload it again and it will show you the changes.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a short hand that implements html code without having to type in an html format. Using different symbols and text in combinations you can quickly make headers, bold text, italic, texts, hyperlinks, images, tables, and more. You can still type in html but it might not be worth it. **>markdown preview to side** in search bar for preview
