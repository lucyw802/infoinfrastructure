An array in JavaScript is a special type of object that stores multiple values in a single variable. Arrays allow developers to organize and manipulate collections of data efficiently. Each value in an array is stored at a numbered index, starting from 0, which makes it easy to access and modify specific elements. Arrays are commonly used to manage lists of related data, such as names, numbers, or Boolean values.

To process each element in an array, loops are commonly used

Arrays are a fundamental part of JavaScript that allow developers to store and manipulate multiple values efficiently. By using loops such as for, while, and do...while, we can iterate through an array and perform operations on its elements. Understanding arrays and loops is essential for working with data in JavaScript applications.
