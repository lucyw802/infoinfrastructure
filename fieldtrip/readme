## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

I chose a man called your statue that depicts york riding a horse and interacting with a dog.

York (1770–1775 – after 1815) was an enslaved man who was the only African-American member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806. A lifelong slave and personal servant of William Clark, York participated in the entire exploration and made significant contributions to its success. In doing so he became the first African American to cross the continent and to see the Pacific Ocean. He has since become an American icon and several monuments depicting him have been erected in honor of his legacy.

### Core Webpages

there would be an index showing a photo of the staute an about page giving background on the specific artwork and character a page about the general history and a page with a 3d scan the user can look at and manipulate. there could also be a page where people can post pictures of themselves with tha statue.

### Design Choices

I would use a warm orange on white for the warmth and vibes. the eiteljorg does a good job so i would base it on that
